Ceres has a daily organic foods market and two cafes with outdoor and indoor dining. They also have a bike shed where you can buy a second hand bike cheap - or take your own to work on. There are three coffee places within 50metres, and the Lomond Hotel Pub right across the road has good live music.",

There's great cafes and fantastic coffee,a gourmet supermarket,wine shop and a variety of restaurants from African (my favourite!) to Malaysian and Italian,and all within walking distance to the property. Just down the road is Footscray,a predominately Vietnamese community with a bit of African too,so wonderful food choices everywhere,including the Footscray Market with its fresh fruit and veg,meat and seafood. Seddon also has an eclectic mix of shops ranging from gifts shops like Sedonia to vintage shops like my very own \"Once More With Feeling\" at the front of the property on Charles St. So you must drop in and say hi when you stay! Its a great friendly neighbourhood that you will fall in love with and not far from the city either or major attractions like Flemington Racecourse and Etihad stadium. Leave your car and take public transport or an Uber, it's that easy.",

The shop is actually at the front of the AirBnb so drop in and say hi when you come to stay. I'm also involved in Theatre and have performed many times at a wonderful Melbourne institution called La Mama. I love music and feel so lucky to live in Melbourne where we have a great live music scene. Sometimes i sing and play guitar and I love both country and western music,I also sing in the Melbourne Mass Gospel choir. My partner is Ray,who is a builder and is responsible for the wonderful renovation at Seddon and who sometimes builds sets for the theatre too. We love to travel and after using airbnb will probably never stay at a hotel again we love it so much. we hope you love it too and will love visiting the west of Melbourne, a wonderfully multicultural place so close to the city and with everything you could imagine.",

We have also used Airbnb world wide and know the standards that we expect and therefore endeavour to make your stay with us as enjoyable as possible.  We are originally from Scotland but have lived in Australia for more than 20 years. . We reckon that we are both friendly, outgoing people. In the past, as a family we have hosted exchange students from Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Japan and China!\nLike the rest of the world, we had to have a break from hosting and travelling during COVID and as a result, we lost our \"SuperHost\" Status which we had held for 8 years - we did not meet the 'required' number of bookings :(. However, our standards have not dropped so you will be guaranteed the same service and facilities.\n",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Kew is known for its charming blend of culture and convenience. It's close enough to the city to be convenient, far enough away to get out from the hustle and bustle. It offers scenic tree lined streets with a mixture of architectural styles, vast parklands including walking & bike tracks, quality groceries, fresh produce and gourmet delights, plus a diverse range of unique cafes and restaurants. Whether you're in the mood for a quick coffee fix or a leisurely brunch with friends, Kew's cafes provide a delightful array of options to satisfy every palate. All of this and you're only 7 kms from the heart of thriving Melbourne city.<br /><br />Arranmore is a short walk away from public transport, the Recreation Centre, a fabulous contemporary art museum (Lyon Housemuseum),  and High Street (the main thoroughfare into the heart of the shopping strip) You'll find wonderful providores, cafes and restaurants. I recommend Toscanos (fruit & veggies) , Woodfrog bakery, and Cannings butcher for y",

I've lived and worked in many places around the world and am always ready for more of the same. When home I love being a host. I enjoy preparing and sharing my spaces and creating memories for others.",
